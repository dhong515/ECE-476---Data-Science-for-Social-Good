# Grameen America Member Feedback Analysis

An analysis of data provided by the non-profit organization Grameen America was done for this project. The analysis was based on attempting to understand the reasons as to why former Grameen America members decided to not renew their loan and terminate their membership. To do so, member feedback comments from the exit survey form data provided to us from Grameen America were examined. The analysis consisted of three different NLP (Natural Language Processing) tasks: Clustering Sentences, Sentiment Analysis, and Keyword Extraction.
